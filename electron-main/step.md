# Project Steps Log

This file is used by AI agents and contributors to record short, chronological steps taken while working on the repository.

Format (one line per entry):
- `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ — <actor>: <short description> — files: <comma-separated paths>`

Example:
- `2025-11-15 12:05Z — ai-agent: added .github/copilot-instructions.md — files: .github/copilot-instructions.md, .gitignore`

Guidance:
- Keep entries concise and factual.
- Use UTC timestamps in ISO-like format as above.
- Include actor (human username or `ai-agent`).
- List the primary files you added/changed for quick audit.

This file is ignored by default (see `.gitignore`).
